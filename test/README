# ESP32 Environmental Sensor Node

This project implements a Wi-Fi connected environmental sensor node using an ESP32-based M5Stack Core and the M5Stack ENV III unit. The system collects temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure data, processes it in a FreeRTOS environment, and publishes the results to an MQTT broker in JSON format.

The project demonstrates embedded software design practices including real-time task separation, I²C sensor integration, network communication, structured data packaging, and fault-tolerant operation.
